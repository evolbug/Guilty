# Guilty
Guilty, the Love2D GUI library, made with Moonscript for use with Lua/Moonscript

`/src` contains the moonscript source code  
`/dist` contains Guilty demo application along with fonts the default theme uses  
`/dist/guilty` contains Guilty library itself

The easiest way to get Guilty is to download `Guilty.love` demo, extract it and replace `main.lua` with your own. `miscellaneous.lua` contains only the License and can be discarded.

## Documentation coming soon!
